# useful_scripts

This is messy collection of scripts that I find myself using often or are part of a testing stage across multiple projects. 

>[!IMPORTANT] (LIKELY) Most of the scripts are not written by myself, at least not in full. I have done my best to cite as many sources as I can for these within each script or elsewhere here.

## Additional blogs, repos and resources for general use
